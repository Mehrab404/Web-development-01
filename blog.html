      <p>The enormous Saturn V rocket is one of humanity's most impressive and important technological achievements.</p>

      <p>In the history of human achievement and scientific progress, few moments are as singularly important as the first time we set foot on the moon. And powering the Apollo missions, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11"> Apollo 11</a> the one that carried <a href="https://www.biography.com/scientists/neil-armstrong" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener">Neil Armstrong</a>, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/space-exploration/buzz-aldrin" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener">Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin</a>, and <a href="https://www.biography.com/scientists/michael-collins" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener">Michael Collins </a>to the lunar surface in July 1969, was the Saturn V rocket.</p>

      <p>Saturn V, pronounced Saturn five, was a heavy lift vehicle that was at the time the most powerful rocket ever to successfully take flight. Not only would this stunning piece of human engineering carry humanity to the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener" >moon</a>, but it would also facilitate the placement of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/50-years-ago-the-launch-of-skylab-americas-first-space-station/" >Skylab</a>, the first space station launched by the U.S. into low-earth orbit.</p>

      <p>These rockets, therefore, became a crucially important factor in humanity's quest to explore space and learn more about our own planet.</p>

      <hr><span class="txt-box">How tall was the Saturn V?</span>
      <p>The design of the Saturn V was overseen by German-American aerospace engineer Werner Von Braun as he served as director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville.</p>
      <p>Standing at 363 feet tall (111 meters), around the height of a 36-story-building and nearly 60 feet (18 m) taller than the Statue of Liberty, the Saturn V was a truly imposing rocket, according to NASA.</p>

      <p>In fact, the initial design of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS), soon to launch as part of the <a href="
        https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-nasas-artemis-program-plans-to-return-astronauts-to-the-moon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Artemis</a> mission is dwarfed by the Saturn V, which stands at a hardly diminutive height of 322 feet (98.1 m), <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/for-kids-and-students/what-was-the-saturn-v-grades-5-8/" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener">according to a NASA</a> SLS fact sheet.

      The Saturn V was also a giant in other ways. The rocket put the "heavy" into "heavy-lift vehicle." 
      </p>
      <p>The Saturn V weighed a staggering 6.2 million poundsâ€Šâ€”â€Šabout equivalent to a herd of 400 elephantsâ€Šâ€”â€Š when fully fueled, with the first stage alone holding 203,400 gallons (770,000 liters) of kerosene fuel and 318,000 gallons (1.2 million liters) of liquid oxygen.
      </p>
      <p>Getting the Saturn V off the ground and away from the surface of <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earth</a> was no mean feat. Fortunately, the Saturn V engines had the goods to back up the rocket's tremendous size. </p>

      <p>To get the Saturn V into orbit and carry humanity to the surface of the moon, the five engines of the first two stages of the rocket used liquid hydrogen fuel to blast off with 34.5 million newtons or 7.6 million pounds of thrust.</p>
      <p>
      NASA puts this into perspective by pointing out that this is more power than could be generated by 85 Hoover Dams. The agency adds that a car that can get 30 miles to the gallon could drive around the globe about 800 times before it ran out of fuel if it could carry the same amount used to launch the Saturn V.
    </p>
      The engines of the Saturn V could carry a payload weighing as much as 130 tons into orbit around the Earth, according to NASA. That's about the weight of 10 school buses or an entire adult blue whale. The rocket was also capable of delivering 50 tons to the surface of the moon, the equivalent of four school buses, five T-Rexes, or almost nine elephants.
      <p>
      Unsurprisingly, the Saturn V's most powerful engines belonged to its first stage as was the stage of the rocket that was tasked with lifting the tremendous mass of a fully fueled rocket away from Earth. </p>
      <p>
      This is one area in which NASA's SLS rocket will up the ante on the Saturn V. In its initial configuration the SLS will launch with 8.8 million pounds of thrust, 15 percent more than the Saturn V.</p>

      <p>
      This will allow the SLS to send 27 tons of payload to the moon's surface. And the following configurations will be even more powerful, capable of carrying even greater payloads to the moon which will be needed for longer more sustainable space missions.</p>

      <hr><span class="txt-box">Saturn V rocket launches: How many flew?</span>
      <p>
      Developed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the Saturn V rocket was the largest of three types of Saturn rockets built by NASA. The smaller Saturn I and Saturn IB were used to carry a crew into orbit around the planet, while the Saturn V would carry humanity beyond orbit and to the surface of the moon.</p>
      <p>
      The first two Saturn V launches, Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 occurred in 1967 and 1968 respectively. Neither of these missions carried a crew and served as tests of the powerful rocket.</p>
      <p>
      The Apollo 8 Saturn V, launched in December 1968 was the first Saturn V mission to carry a crew to space. It was also the second crewed Apollo mission after Apollo 1â€Šâ€”â€Šan ill-fated mission that never flew after a cabin fire killed the crew and destroyed its craft.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Apollo 8 team of Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders would orbit the moon without landing on the lunar surface with progress towards the moon landing continuing with Apollo missions 9 and 10, both carried by Saturn V rockets.</p>
      <a href="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCgGwkmdWR3pCGxa5uuQHb-1200-80.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" download="Timeline"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCgGwkmdWR3pCGxa5uuQHb-1200-80.png" height="600px" width="400"></a>
      <p>
      Apollo 9 would see the crew test the Apollo moon lander by flying it in Earth orbit without landing. Apollo 10 would take a step further, with the Saturn V testing the lander deeper in space but still not landing on the moon. </p>

      <p>This giant leap for mankind would finally occur in July 1969 when a Saturn V carried the Apollo 11 mission and the lunar lander to the lunar surface.</p>

      <p>Saturn V rockets would continue to lift the crews of Apollo missions to the moon with Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 journeying to the lunar surface. The infamous Apollo 13 mission would see a Saturn V rocket carry a crew to space who would be unable to land on the moon as a result of problems with the Apollo spacecraft. </p>

      <p>The final Saturn V mission would blast off in 1973, carrying the Skylab space station to orbit around the planet, according to the NASA History Office.</p>

      <p>All the Apollo mission Saturn V rockets blasted off from the historic Launch Complex 39 at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Both Launch Complex 39 pads, launch pads A and B are still hosting rocket launches today.</p>

      <p>Not only does the launch complex see numerous  SpaceX launches, but in the near future NASA's SLS will kick start the Artemis mission from Launch Complex 39B, with the mission set to eventually carry humanity back to the moon, landing the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. </p>
